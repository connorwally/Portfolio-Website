# Portfolio Website

This is a repo for a Portfolio Website I built using React casually over the course of a couple months.
It was a good learning experience and the key take aways are as follows:
- Define image files in React to save time when building
- Design for mobile sites first and then scale up to 1600px - don't design for 1920px
- Need to add a call-to-action in my projects section so people can learn more about my projects
- Be careful using alot of animations - Will look jank on browsers without hardware acceleration
- Don't overcomplicate divs. Remove pointless divs
- Need to make modifications for Safari browser/test on multiple browsers
